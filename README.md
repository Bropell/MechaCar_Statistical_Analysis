# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing statistical analyses on different datasets regarding AutosRUs' newest
prototype, the MechaCar, using the R programming language. Some of these tests include: multiple linear 
regression, visualizations for summary statistics, and a t-test. For the last part of the challenge, a 
study was designed to compare the Mechacar model against the competition.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The first task was to design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several
variables including: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance. A
screenshot of the output is displayed in the image below.
